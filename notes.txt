I used libtcod-cffi, YMMV

need to put this as the import
import tcod as libtcod

Other notes, I think the library is looking for a py27 environment. The changes I had to make were really related to py3 not the tutorial being wrong.

So part of the way through I switched with conda to a 27 environment

activate py27env

look up how to list the environments in conda to see the other choices.

Got the stupid arial font from the libtcod source on bitbucket
https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod/src/c5a397b8f50a5409da26c0025a11f090bb842f73/data/fonts/arial10x10.png?at=default

mainline1.py - this is really the part1 code
	- I changed the player positions to be int, libtcod would not work otherwise

mainline_map.py - map part of tutorial
	- I changed the position in the object to be an int

mainline_dungeon.py - dungeon part of the tutorial
	- I changed some of this (int stuff)
	- then I switched to py27 and did not look back
